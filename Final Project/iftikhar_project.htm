<h1>CSE 3541 Final Project</h1>
	<h3>Aisha Iftikhar</h3>
<h2>Idea:</h2>
	<p>For my final project in CSE 3541, Icreated an infinite 3D runner game, similar to Temple Run; 
	my basic idea is to create something similar to the images below.
	My game has a character with the ability to run, jump, and turn left and right on an endless path. 
	When the character falls over the edge of the path, he dies and the game starts over.
	I added effects like the cobblestone path to make the game look like the temple run format. 
<h2>Future Work:</h2>
	For a more advanced version, I will attempt to implement a point system within the game, allowing the character to collect coins. However, this may not be possible, so I will only include this feature if I have the available time. It will not be part of my basic game.
	I would also like to add more features and effects to the game, to make it more similar to temple run. 
	Unlike the actual temple run game, I do not have my character being chased. The only possibility of dying will come from hitting an obstable like a tree or falling. So I might try to implement this type of ability.</p>
<h2>Framework & Techniques:</h2>
	<p>I used the implemention of the animator from Lab 5 to animate the character. </p>
	<p>I used assets from the Unity store, i.e. the cobblestone path. </p>

<h2>Timeline:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>11/8: submit proposal and start project</li>
